# Independence, Basis and Dimension

## Linear independence 

Suppose $A$ is an $m$ by $n$ matrix with $m < n $, $A$ has at least one free variable, so there are nonzero solutions to $A\mathrm{x} = \mathrm{0}$. 

We say vectors $x_1, x_2, ...x_n$ are **linearly independent** (or just independent) if $c_1x_1 + c_2x_2 + · · · + c_nx_n = 0$ only when $c_1, c_2, ..., c_n$ are all 0. 

Two vectors are independent if they do not lie on the same line. The column vectors of $A$ are independent exactly when the nullspace of $A$ contains only the zero vector.  

If the columns of $A$ are independent then all columns are pivot columns, the rank of $A$ is $n$, and there are no free variables. If the columns of A are dependent then the rank of $A$ is less than $n$ and there are free variables.  

## Spanning a space 

Vectors $v_1, v_2, ...v_k$ **span** a space when the space consists of all combinations of those vectors.  

## Basis and dimension 

A basis for a vector space is a sequence of vectors $v_1, v_2, ...v_d$ with two properties: 

- $v_1, v_2, ...v_d$ are independent
- $v_1, v_2, ...v_d$ span the vector space.  

One basis for $R^3$ is :
$$
\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Basis for a subspace 

Given a space, every basis for that space has the same number of vectors; that number is the **dimension** of the space. So there are exactly $n$ vectors in every basis for $R^n$.
